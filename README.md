# FTC Explorer
A simple React Native/Expo powered app for exploring data made available by the official FTC Data API.

### Getting started
- Clone the project and run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Create a file in the root directory called `Secrets.js`. This is where you will put your API key:
```javascript
export const FIRST_API_KEY='<YOUR FIRST API KEY>'
```
You can get an API key from https://ftc-events.firstinspires.org/services/API/register

## Contributing
If you have changes or contributions, open an issue or PR. If you want to contribute but don't know where to start, check out the issues and see if there is something in there that you want to contribute to.

Minor comments are fine as plaintext, but **mark important comments with emojis as defined [here](https://gist.github.com/parmentf/035de27d6ed1dce0b36a)**. I know it is odd but it makes it a lot easier to review important commits.
